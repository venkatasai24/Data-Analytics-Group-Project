# Rare Event Classification Project

## Overview
This project aims to perform rare event classification using various data balancing techniques and training with different classifiers.

## Data Balancing Techniques
Three different data balancing techniques are used:
- Random Over-sampling (ROS)
- Random Under-sampling (RUS)
- Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE)

## Classifiers
Three different classifiers are trained on the balanced datasets:
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest (RF)
- Gradient Boosting (GB)
